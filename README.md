## What is Rock Paper Scissors?
Rock Paper Scissors is a recreation of the classic playground game, built with **React**.

Players test their luck and strategy against the computer, with game state managed through React hooks and persisted using **localStorage**.

## Features
- Play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer  
- Interactive and responsive UI  
- Game state managed using React hooks  
- Game progress saved using **localStorage**  

## Technologies Used
- **React** – Component-based UI and state management  
- **JavaScript** – Game logic and interactions  
- **localStorage** – Persisting game state between sessions  

### React Concepts Practiced
- Creating and maintaining state with `useState`  
- Using `useEffect` to sync state changes with `localStorage`  
- Preventing unnecessary re-renders  

## Future Improvements
- Add Player vs Player mode (no computer opponent)  
- Add animations to build excitement around results  
- Allow users to choose number of rounds
