# Rock Paper Scissors

## Description

### What is Rock Paper Scissors

The classic playground game Rock Paper Scissors recreated with React. Test your luck and strategy against the computer. 

### Technologies used

I have used React for this project, becuase I have the:

- Ability to create and maintain state
- Use of useEffect to allow saving to localStorage whenever state changes and avoid unnecessary re-renders. 

## Implementations for the future

- Player 1 and Player 2 (not the computer)
- Animations to build excitement for the results of who won
- Choice to choose how many rounds to do
